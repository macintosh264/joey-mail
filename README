==README==
To use joey-mail follow these simple steps:
1. Generate RSA Keys.
	- cd <DIRECTORY WHERE THIS FILE IS>
	- php -f ./rsakeygen/gen.php
	- at this point 2 files should appear in the rsakeygen directory "RSAPRIVATE" and "RSAPUBLIC". These are your keys.
1b. Copy the private key and the public key from the rsakeygen folder to the server folder
1c. Copy the public key to the directory on your webserver where you intend to place the script to send mail from.

2. Copy mail_class.php (./sendmail_scripts/mail_class.php) to the same directory as the public key ****VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE PUBLIC KEY AND THIS SCRIPT ARE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY****
3. Done!

===USAGE===
First, cd into the directory where you downloaded joey-mail, then do the following: php -f ./server/mailserver.php
Do not close this terminal window, because mail will not be sent. You must either set this as startup application or run this command manualy at startup. This script will never stop. To stop it manualy press control-c.
Example located at ./sendmail_scripts/test.php

To send mail you must define many variables and encode them as json and then take that string and put it in the mail quene, which is done through the MailerClass (./sendmail_scripts/test.php). Use like this:

<?php
require("mail_class.php");
$mailer = new MailerClass();
$mailer->loadKey();
$message = array('to' => "test@example.com",'subject' => "test", 'html' => true, 'body' =>  "Body",'smtp_settings' => array('host' => 'smtp.gmail.com', 'port' => 465, 'ssl' => true, 'username' => "you@gmail.com", 'password' => 'yourpassword'), 'fromName' => 'your name', 'fromAddress' => "your e-mail address");
$mailer->sendMail(json_encode($message));

//Message is in quene

?>

Make sure you are running memcached on localhost on the default port. To change this alter the __construct method of mail_class.php (./sendmail_class/mail_class.php)

===REQUIREMENTS===

You MUST have memcached installed and running on localhost on the default port for this to work. You can change the host and port if you must by altering the __construct method of mail_class.php (./sendmail_class/mail_class.php). To install memcahced on debain/ubuntu(maybe) run the following command in the termainal: sudo apt-get install memcahced

===MAIL VARIABLES===
- to (address to send to, string)
- subject (subject of the message, string)
- html (is the body HTML?, boolean)
- body (the body of the message, string)
- smtp_settings (smtp auth, and other settings; associtive array)
	- host (smtp host, string)
	- port (smtp port, int)
	- ssl (is the host ssl?, boolean)
	- username (smtp username, string) * Not required, if not set, then auth is not used
	- password (smtp password, string) * Not required, if not set, then auth is not used
- fromName (your name, string)
- fromAddress (your e-mail address that will appear in the from field)

put these vars into an associtive array and give the class a json_encode of this array (ie. json_encode($mailArray))
